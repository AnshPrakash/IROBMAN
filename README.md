# IROBMAN: Intelligent Robotic Manipulation



This course delves into advanced algorithmic approaches for enabling robots to autonomously manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments like homes. It covers fundamental principles for equipping autonomous robots with perception, planning, and decision-making abilities. Topics include deep learning and 3D geometry-based perception, robot kinematics and trajectory generation, collision-free motion planning, task-and-motion planning, and adaptive/reactive manipulation through dynamics and control.

## List of Topics

- Topology in robotics and rigid body motions   
- Refresher on forward and inverse kinematics and dynamics  
- Differential kinematics and optimization  
- Geometric perception and object pose detection  
- Object pose estimation and tracking with multi-sensor fusion  
- Grasp generation and evaluation  
- Trajectory Optimization  
- Search and sampling-based motion planning  
- Force control  
- Visuomotor policies and intuitive physics  
- Task and motion planning
